Answers:

1. Write a query to select employees and their corresponding managers and their salaries

mysql> SELECT e.employee_id AS employee_id, 
e.first_name AS employee_first_name, 
e.last_name AS employee_last_name_lname, e.salary AS employee_salary, 
m.employee_id AS manager_id, 
m.first_name AS manager_firsntame,
m.last_name AS manager_lastname,
m.salary AS manager_salary FROM  employee e 
LEFT JOIN employee m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;


2. Write a query to show count of employees under each manager in descending order

mysql> SELECT mgr.employee_id AS manager_id, mgr.first_name AS manager_first_name, 
mgr.last_name AS manager_last_name, COUNT(emp.employee_id) AS num_employee FROM employee emp 
JOIN employee mgr ON emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id GROUP BY mgr.employee_id, mgr.first_name, mgr.last_name ORDER BY num_employee DESC;



3.Find the count of employees in each department

mysql> SELECT     d.department_id,    d.department_name, 
COUNT(e.employee_id) AS num_employee FROM  departments d 
LEFT JOIN  employee e ON d.department_id = e.department_id 
GROUP BY d.department_id, d.department_name 
ORDER BY  d.department_id;


4.Write an SQL query to display employees who earn more than the average salary in that company

mysql> SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary FROM  employee WHERE  salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee);


5.Find the maximum salary from each department.

mysql> SELECT d.department_id,    d.department_name,  MAX(e.salary) AS max_salary FROM  departments d 
JOIN   employee e ON d.department_id = e.department_id 
GROUP BY  d.department_id, d.department_name ORDER BY d.department_id;



6. Display the managers and the reporting employees who work in different departments


mysql> SELECT mgr.employee_id AS manager_id, 
mgr.first_name AS manager_first_name,
mgr.last_name AS manager_last_name, 
mgr.department_id AS manager_department_id,
emp.employee_id AS employee_id, 
emp.first_name AS employee_first_name,
emp.last_name AS employee_last_name,
emp.department_id AS employee_department_id FROM  employee mgr
JOIN  employee emp ON mgr.employee_id = emp.manager_id 
WHERE mgr.department_id <> emp.department_id ORDER BY mgr.employee_id,
